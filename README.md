# Detekt
In today's digital age, the proliferation of spam and fraudulent activities poses significant challenges to online security and user experience. This project aims to develop a comprehensive web-based system utilizing machine learning techniques to detect and mitigate spam SMS, email, and fake  URLs.Our website, "Detekt", employs advanced algorithms to  shield one from these hazards. We utilize logistic regression to identify phishing websites, ensuring that one doesn't fall victim to deceptive online traps. Multinomial Naive Bayes is used to filter out spam SMS, allowing one to enjoy uninterrupted communication. To safeguard finances, we employ decision tree analysis to detect and thwart fraudulent online payments. Detekt is a vigilant protector, ensuring a secure and worry-free online experience.
